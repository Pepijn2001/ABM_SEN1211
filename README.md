## Introduction,
Hi there,

Welcome to the folder (ABM_SEN1211) that contains all of the detail of the final 
assignment of the Agent Based Modeling course at the TU Delft. In this folder,
you wil find three other folders and three seperate files. This README will discuss
the contents of everything in this folder. 


## Assets
The assets folder contains two files. Both are floorplans of the TU Delft aula, (one with
one stage, the other with two stages) which are used to generate the floorplan that
functions as the agents environment.


## Data
In the data folder, the model data of the base case, scenarios and sensitivity run are saved.
This folder also contains the agent data for the verification run, both the normal behaviour
and the evacuation behaviour. These .csv files are used in a later stadium to analyse the
resuls of the model, as well as conduct the sensitivy analysis and verification of the model.


## Graphs
The last folder is the graphs folder. The graphs in this folder originate from the 
results_analysis notebook in the main brance. They have however not been automatically 
places in this folder, but copied and pasted by hand, after they have been plot in that 
notebook. 


## Seperate files
The FINAL MODEL nodebook contains the model used to study the evacuation efficiency of the
TU Delft Aula during OWeekenings. In the other two notebooks, data analysis is conducted.
All analysis besides the verification is visible in the results_analysis notebook. Lastly,
the final report summarizing the analysis as well as describing how the model came to be
in the first place, is also present in the main branche of the GitHub.


Enjoy reading!
Hasta la visa, Group 1
